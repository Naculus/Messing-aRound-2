    <p class="p">This is a project on web development. This is the first time that I've built a website from scratch. I feel like this site is starting to look pretty cool. My plan is to put everything that I have learned in order to create a better
      looking site. So cross your fingers and hold on, because it is going to be a bumpy ride!</p>
    <h3 class="section-summary">A Summary</h3>
    <p class="p2">My goal of this website is to make it look like a kid that just got a new toy. That's why I have a picture of one of my favorite, trippy and in my opion, the epitome of what saturday morning cartoons should look like.</p>
